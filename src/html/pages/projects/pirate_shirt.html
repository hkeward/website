          <p>
            I am hand-sewing a pirate shirt, which I have learned I should refer to as an "18th century men's shirt",
            by following the very
            thorough and wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2S1omLTWAk">tutorial</a> and <a

            Vincent has really inspired me to sew. He is such a very gentle person, dedicated to creating the things he
            loves with care and skill, and it brings me joy to read his blog and watch his videos.

        <h3>Measurements</h3>
        <p>
          Two yards of fabric are enough to make one shirt. Every piece is a rectangle, which makes them very easy to
          cut!

            ‡ This can be square, 59 or 60 cm or larger, but the width left after cutting out the main body in this case
            was not enough to reach 59cm in width.

            I pre-washed the fabric to shrink it since I will machine wash the finished shirt.

            The sleeves can be laid out next to the
            main body piece. I cut from the largest to the smallest piece.

          <li>
            I cut each rectangle using the 'thread-pulling' method, where I pulled a thread and used that as a guide to
            cut along to ensure that all corners are square.

        <div class="img-and-text">
          <div>
            It took a very long time to cut out all the pieces. I think I watched an entire season of <i>Only Murders
              in
              the Building</i> while slowly cutting it out. That being said, this was my first time thread-pulling; I
            think I did get faster as I went along.

          <div>Sewing started! Here I've sewn (sewed??) the first part of the front split seam (words?). It's the front
            seam of
            the shirt.

        <div class="img-and-text">
          <div>
            Here I've put in the front gusset. This is a heart-shaped piece (made from the 4.5cm square by folding it in
            half and cutting out this heart shape). The edges are folded in and this is sewn onto the inside of the
            shirt (shown here from the outside).
            <p>
              This is reinforced using buttonhole stitches around the edge. A 'bar
              tack' is the line of threads across the middle, then you do more buttonhole stitches across those threads.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is all in order to
              reinforce this front seam so that it doesn't rip, particularly when you take the shirt on and off.

            Here I've completed sewing in the neck gusset and I have sewn on the shoulder binding. I don't actually
            have a seam under this, but I think it will still strengthen the shirt, particularly if I wear a bag over my
            shoulder.
            <p>
              I think I am getting more of a hang of stitching here. I feel like my stitches are even in length, and I
              am getting better at keeping them straight.

          <div>
            Here I am preparing to sew the collar onto the neck. I have two lines of thread, which are sewn uh,
            evenly(?) - i.e. I have tried to closely line up the top row of stitches with the bottom ones, so that when
            I pull the threads and form the gathers they form evenly across the two rows of gathering thread.
            <p>
              I have marked the center of the back of the body piece. This will line up with the center of the collar
              piece. The 1/4 and 3/4 marks of the collar piece line up with the middle of the shoulder gussets, and the
              edges (minus 1cm of seam allowance) of the collar line up with the edges of the front seam.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="img-and-text">
          <div>
            The opening around the neck is larger than the collar; the gathering threads are pulled and gathers are
            created until the above mentioned parts line up, then gathers are whip stitched on from the body piece to
            the collar, which has its seam allowance folded over and is lapped over the gathered part of the body.

          Here is the completed neck section.
          <p>
            Also I think it's inescapably clear at this point that little did I know that you <i>can</i> actually
            over-iron linen, and this is why the shoulder gusset is considerably darker than the surrounding fabric. I
            was trying to get it really flat after sewing on the first side and clearly held the iron on it for quite
            some time ... woops.

      <div>
        That's where I'm at right now. I'm currently preparing to sew the arms on, which I am nervous but excited for.
        <p>
          Vincent very kindly answered a question I had about how to attach the arm + the binding, and I am hopeful I
          can
          make a beautiful and careful seam here. I feel like I am making good progress, it is starting to look like a
          shirt!
