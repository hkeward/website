          It would be very cool to recreate this experiment. Keep a lab journal. Write observations. Observe Mendel's
          rule in action.

          This one is probably either unsafe or unsavory. But I would like to see the look on Spencer's or Emma's face
          when I unveiled it. Perhaps use in charcuterie some day for the baguettes.

          Mailbox
        </h3>
        <p>
          My current mailbox lets in rain and snow, and is hard to access for the postman. I would like to make a cute
          but functional mailbox that I can mount on a good solid wooden post in the lawn somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thought was to make the mailbox in the shape of my house, but in miniature, but I do want it to be
          functional and I don't know how well I could work that. I suppose I don't really actually need to make all the
          interior structure, it can be hollow and just hold letters. Perhaps the roof swings off or something.

          Spaghetti
        </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            I would like to make a scrumptious spaghetti monster that kind of seems like he is a little guy. His
            outsides are made of garlic bread, his insides, spaghetti with red sauce. Udon noodles are
            infinitely superior to spaghetti, so probably those.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is eaten by ripping him open. Steam comes pouring out, and perhaps, a tiny, distant wail. Was that..
            just the sound of the dough being rent? The squeak of the noodles? Surely not, the soul leaving the
            body..? You have made him, you are his creator, you have imbued mere bread and sauce with Life, and then
            you have Taken it Away.

        On the left, see my initial idea for what he would look like -- and on the right he has been beautifully
        brought to life in clay by Lindsay!

        What do I do with all these oranges?
      </h3>
      <div class="img-and-text">
        <div>As part of our fall party, Spencer wanted to make mulled wine, and for this he needed a single orange.
          He
          went to Costco and bought a sack of 16 oranges. In despair, I found a dear woman on Instagram who made
          garlands of orange peels. Very cute idea. I got some tiny cookie cutters and spent an evening carefully
          peeling and cutting oranges. I used some orange cotton thread and a thick needle to string each orange
          into
          place. I think they turned out very cute!
          <p>
            After a few days the oranges start to try and curl, but I think they look very festive and nice all the
            same.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think I'll also use this to make garnish for the bar in the future, it's really very cute and quick to
            make a whole bunch of them.
