          It would be very cool to recreate this experiment. Keep a lab journal. Write observations. Observe Mendel's
          rule in action.

          This one is probably either unsafe or unsavory. But I would like to see the look on Spencer's or Emma's face
          when I unveiled it. Perhaps use in charcuterie some day for the baguettes.

          Mailbox

        <p>
          My current mailbox lets in rain and snow, and is hard to access for the postman. I would like to make a cute
          but functional mailbox that I can mount on a good solid wooden post in the lawn somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thought was to make the mailbox in the shape of my house, but in miniature, but I do want it to be
          functional and I don't know how well I could work that. I suppose I don't really actually need to make all the
          interior structure, it can be hollow and just hold letters. Perhaps the roof swings off or something.

              I would like to make a scrumptious spaghetti monster that kind of seems like he is a little guy. His
              outsides are made of garlic bread, his insides, spaghetti with red sauce. Udon noodles are
              infinitely superior to spaghetti, so probably those.
            </p>
            <p>
              He is eaten by ripping him open. Steam comes pouring out, and perhaps, a tiny, distant wail. Was that..
              just the sound of the dough being rent? The squeak of the noodles? Surely not, the soul leaving the
              body..? You have made him, you are his creator, you have imbued mere bread and sauce with Life, and then
              you have Taken it Away.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is what he would look like ---->
