          Breadboard remote control

        <p>Create a remote control that I can use to physically interact with lights and other home automations.</p>

          Split pea experiments
        </h3>
        <p>
          It would be very cool to recreate this experiment. Keep a lab journal. Write observations. Observe Mendel's
          rule in action.

        <h3 id="bread-cutter">
          Bread cutter
        </h3>
        <p>
          This one is probably either unsafe or unsavory. But I would like to see the look on Spencer's or Emma's face
          when I unveiled it. Perhaps use in charcuterie some day for the baguettes.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3 id="mailbox">
          Mailbox
        </h3>
        <p>
          My current mailbox lets in rain and snow, and is hard to access for the postman. I would like to make a cute
          but functional mailbox that I can mount on a good solid wooden post in the lawn somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thought was to make the mailbox in the shape of my house, but in miniature, but I do want it to be
          functional and I don't know how well I could work that. I suppose I don't really actually need to make all the
          interior structure, it can be hollow and just hold letters. Perhaps the roof swings off or something.
