# Heather's personal website

A sandbox for Heather's personal projects.

## Local dev

Run `make local` to start the nginx server with src files mounted. The website will be accessible at localhost. You should be able to update the files and reload the page to view edits without restarting the image.

## TODOs

- Add a footer; put the GitHub link there
    - Probably use an icon for this instead of an image
